            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WHO Informeth and ſaith, That <hi>William Bradley</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of His Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace for the County of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford</hi> in the Year 1677. gave him the ſaid Informant an Oath of Secrecy touching the Plot intended and deſigned in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> and the reſt of the Confederates againſt the Kings Majeſty; At which time he imparted to this Informant, the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> had received a Commiſſion from the <hi>French</hi> King to be a Colonel of Horſe in the County of <hi>Waterford,</hi> and that the ſaid <hi>William Bradley</hi> was to be his Lieutenant Colonel, and deſired this Informant to provide himſelf with Horſe and Arms, and to procure as many as he could of thoſe he dare truſt: and that this Informant ſhould have a Command of being a Captain under the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> and Him.</p>
               <p>Whereupon this Informant did provide himſelf and ſpeak unto <hi>John Follis, James Finican</hi> and <hi>Dennis Mac-Namarra</hi> to provide themſelves with ſuch Neceſſaries as were requiſite for that purpoſe; informing them alſo, That Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi> did impart ſuch matters unto this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, and who knew that the ſaid <hi>Mac-Namarra</hi> had imparted ſuch matters to the ſaid <hi>James</hi> &amp; <hi>Dennis,</hi> who afterwards did confeſs the ſame to <hi>his Grace the Lord Lieutenant</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> and before this Informant had liberty to ſpeak with them, or they with him, being then kept cloſe Priſoner from any one of the Kings Evidence.</p>
               <p>The precedent Examination this Informant gave, when on a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preferred by the reſt of the Kings Evidences, this Informant was kept from any of the Earls Friends and from <hi>Quarter-Maſter Ely,</hi> who was always with this Informant before and not denied to be with him; But on the Petition of the aforeſaid Gent. then it was Ordered, That this Informant ſhould be kept cloſe and not to have any to come to him: This Informant was then very fearful to diſcover his Mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100560:3"/>
of the guilt that was upon him, being Condemned; which after a promiſe of pardon, if this Informant ſpake the Truth, he then reſolved to Diſcover ſo far as he knew, though againſt himſelf: Upon which he freely declared his mind in this following examination.</p>
               <p>After the aforeſaid <hi>William Bradley</hi> did impart to this Informant the aforeſaid Treaſon, this Informant met with the <hi>Earl of Tyrone</hi> upon the Land of <hi>Gaveſton</hi> in the County of <hi>Waterford</hi> with two of his men, <hi>viz, Thomas Power</hi> his Gentleman, and <hi>Garret Mac-Teige</hi> his Follower, and another whoſe name is <hi>Luke Power,</hi> this Informant haveing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with him one <hi>William Power,</hi> and <hi>Boetius Clauſy,</hi> being then abroad Hunting with Dogs; The ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> knowing this Informant at a diſtance, called to him, upon which this Informant went to him: The ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> taking this Informant from the company, asked him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi> had imparted to him any matter of Secrecy; this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant replyed, that he had,, The ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> then told this Informant that he muſt be very private and diſcover it to none, but thoſe he was very ſure of. After which, the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> drew a Liſt out of his Pocket, and ſhewed this Informant a Liſt of ſeveral perſons that were to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Officers, both in the County of <hi>Waterford,</hi> County of <hi>Cork,</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Kerry,</hi> County of <hi>Limerick</hi> and County of <hi>Clare,</hi> which this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant took ſpecial notice of and knew ſeveral of the Perſons; amongſt the reſt, the <hi>Earl</hi> entred my Name with my own Pen and Ink in the Liſt; The ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> telling this Informant, he had his Commiſſion ſent him from the <hi>French</hi> King, under Hand and Seal to be a Colonel of a Regiment of Horſe in the County of <hi>Waterford,</hi> and ſaid there was hardly a County in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but perſons were appointed by the <hi>French</hi> King for that purpoſe: and named in the County of <hi>Limerick,</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Peirce Lucy</hi> and the Lord <hi>Brittas,</hi> Sir <hi>John Fitz gerrald, David Fitz-gerrald</hi> and ſeveral others in the County of <hi>Clare, John Mac-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marra</hi> and ſeveral others in the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> Sir <hi>Turlo Mac-Mahan</hi> and ſeveral others in the County of <hi>Cork,</hi> and that the ſaid <hi>Earl of Tyrone</hi> was to be Colonel in the County of <hi>Waterford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi> to be his Lieutenant Colonel, <hi>Quarter-Maſter Ely</hi> his Major, Mr. <hi>John Butler</hi> Senior his Captain, with the names of ſeveral others of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which he did not read unto this Informant; The ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> ſaying they were to raiſe ſeveral hundreds of men in every County, and that the Superiour Officers were to meet on purpoſe to return an exact account of their Forces to the <hi>French</hi> King: On which the ſaid King would Land
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100560:3"/>
many thouſands of men in the River <hi>Shanon,</hi> and aſſoon as they were Landed, the next buſineſs was to go to the City of <hi>Limerick</hi> with 500 men and divide them into two Parts, the one party to enter the City at Candle-light, and that at ſeveral Gates, and ſuch as beſt knew the City were appointed to ſet upon the Guards and put them all to the Sword, and the reſt to be hard by the City, and to enter in immediatly when the Alarm was given, and the Body of the Army to draw up as faſt as they could.</p>
               <p>By which, ſaid the <hi>Earl,</hi> we do not queſtion but to poſſeſs our ſelves of the City and <hi>Kings Caſtle,</hi> and to baniſh the <hi>Engliſh</hi> very ſoon; and indeed ſaid the <hi>Earl,</hi> 'tis the Providence of God to bring ſome Down-fall on that unjuſt King, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Ormond</hi> and his Children, that wronged me in ſo high a Nature on the account of <hi>Villiers:</hi> therefore ſaid the <hi>Earl,</hi> Go home, loſe no time, but make your ſelves ready, for we know not how ſoon occaſion may require your Aſſiſtance, and ſpeak to as many Friends as you can, which accordingly this Informant did and provided Horſe and Arms for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>After Diſcovery made hereof by <hi>Hubburt Bourke</hi> as you may read in his Information, who partly knew the Proceedings, and having Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ſame, was bound by Recognizance to proſecute the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> at the next Aſſize at <hi>Waterford,</hi> he did for want of this Informants and others Teſtimonies abſent himſelf from the Aſſizes, unto which he was bound, and for other Reaſons mentioned in his Examination.</p>
               <p>But in a ſhort time after, the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> hearing that Mr. <hi>Bourke</hi> was going for <hi>England</hi> to make his application to the King and Parliament; the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> Commanded this Informant to write unto the ſaid <hi>Bourke,</hi> which accordingly he did, and ſignified in his Letter, that this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant would very willingly ſpeak with him, but he not anſwering this Informants expectation, this Informant went himſelf to him at <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and Courted him to go along with this Informant to his Houſe, which he prevailed with him to do.</p>
               <p>This Informant then haſtened to the ſaid <hi>Earl,</hi> and gave him an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his proceedings, which the <hi>Earl</hi> liked very well, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ordered <hi>Major Butler</hi> and <hi>John Rovan,</hi> and this Informant to confer with the ſaid <hi>Bourke,</hi> and at the Mill of <hi>Carrygninier</hi> we met, and according to the ſaid <hi>Earls</hi> order did offer the ſaid <hi>Bourke</hi> a Farm Stock, together with a ſum of mony ſo as that he would charge Mr. <hi>Villiers,</hi> Captain <hi>Nicholas,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradley,</hi> and others with Suborning
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100560:4"/>
or prompting the ſaid <hi>Bourke</hi> to proſecute the ſaid <hi>Earl,</hi> and that he ſhould acknowledge it, and Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi> aforeſaid ſhould confeſs the ſame, and that ſo <hi>Bourke</hi> and <hi>Bradley</hi> ſhould be committed Witneſſes againſt <hi>Villiers</hi> and <hi>Nicholas,</hi> upon which the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> would bring his Action of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> againſt <hi>Villiers</hi> and <hi>Nicholas</hi> for 40000<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> which was contrived by Mr. <hi>Andrew Lynne</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi> the ſaid <hi>Earls</hi> Friends, unto which the ſaid <hi>Bourke</hi> refuſed to conſent.</p>
               <p>Here it is to be obſerved, That Mr. <hi>Villiers,</hi> and Captain <hi>Nicholas</hi> were at Law with the ſaid <hi>Earl,</hi> and therefore the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> did ſuppoſe the World would ſooner believe what was laid to their Charge, upon the <hi>Earls</hi> account, though falſly alledged againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bourke</hi> not accepting the aforeſaid Offers, the <hi>Earl</hi> then Petition'd the Lord Lieutenant and Council, who ſent a Summons for the ſaid <hi>Bourke,</hi> and Brought him to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and being Examined of ſeveral matters, he gave in his Informations, and got alſo Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jury</hi> to be Summoned up, and to be Examined, upon whole Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: A Summons was iſſued out againſt Quarter-maſter <hi>Ely, John Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi> Major <hi>Butler</hi> aforeſaid, and <hi>Lawrence Smillirand</hi> and this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, who were all ſent for to the Council-Board; Quarter-Maſter <hi>Ely</hi> went firſt to the <hi>Earls</hi> Houſe to have Inſtructions touching the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement thereof. The <hi>Earl</hi> alſo ſent to his Gentleman Mr. <hi>Power</hi> for this Informant, he being then in <hi>Waterford,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Power</hi> came to this Informant and tould him, That the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Tyrone</hi> and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Maſter <hi>Ely</hi> ſent for this Informant, to the intent he might repair to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and having no Horſe with him at <hi>Waterford,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> the <hi>Earls</hi> Gentleman provided this Informant with a Horſe, on which he went with him to <hi>Curronymore</hi> to the <hi>Earls</hi> Houſe, where this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant met with the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> and Quarter-Maſter <hi>Ely</hi> together.</p>
               <p>Upon which the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> &amp; Quarter-Maſter <hi>Ely</hi> took this Informant into the Garden, and there did agree to ſend to <hi>John Rovan,</hi> who came immediately, at which time the <hi>Earl</hi> &amp; Quarter-Maſter <hi>Ely</hi> did inſtruct us what we ſhould ſay, when we came to <hi>Dublin</hi> before the Council; and told this Informant the great Danger, if we ſhould diſcover any thing of the Matter: but profering an Oath unto us, and finding us unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Swear what they would have us to Swear, the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> then told us, that we ſhould be Abſolved by <hi>Dean Powers</hi> his Couſen and the reſt of the Clergy, and after inſtructing us in the garden for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, the <hi>Earl</hi> gave this Informant an Horſe, and gave <hi>John

               <p>This Informant alſo had money from Quarter-Maſter <hi>Ely,</hi> whilſt he was in the Purſivants hand, and ſeveral Maſſes were ſaid in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the <hi>Earl</hi> and this Informant, whilſt this Informant continued from Diſcovering, but ſince hath Excommunicated him.</p>
               <p>But at length Mr. <hi>Ivy</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> Petition'd the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Council to have this Informant kept cloſe Priſoner, and to keep the <hi>Earls</hi> Friends and Solicitors from this Informant, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly was done.</p>

               <p>You may obſerve that while this Informant denied to confeſs the Truth and conceal the Plot, the <hi>Earls</hi> Friends got a Petition writ againſt Mr. <hi>Ivy,</hi> to be preferred to the Lord Lieutenant and Council, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>In the mean time this Informant being kept from them, his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence forced him to confeſs the Truth.

            <head>THE DEPOSITION OF JAMES NASH.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>JAmes Naſh</hi> of the County of <hi>Limerick,</hi> depoſeth, That about Four Years ago, Captain <hi>John Purden,</hi> after he had heard Maſs, took this Deponent aſide, and after ſeveral inconſiderable diſcourſes, queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned this Deponent why he did not go into <hi>France,</hi> being the only place to improve him, and make him a compleat Man, for that there were like to be troubleſome times, and there would be want of ſuch improved Men. But being no further preſſed at that time, This Deponent took little notice thereof. Soon after, this Deponent being at Maſs in the ſaid <hi>Purden</hi>'s houſe, <hi>Burgatt</hi> a Prieſt applied himſelf to this Deponent much after the manner <hi>Purden</hi> had formerly, and in concluſion, commanded this Deponent to go to Captain <hi>Thomas Mac Everie</hi>'s houſe, for there he had ſomewhat material to impart unto him; and imediately after they had dined, there the ſaid <hi>Mac Everie</hi> took this Deponent aſide, and after having Sworn him to ſecreſie, diſcourſed with him as followeth.</p>
            <p>You know, ſaith he, that the King at <hi>Breda</hi> before his Reſtauration, promiſed the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentry to reſtore them to their Eſtates and Religion, but ſince this is not performed, we have deſigned to caſt off the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bondage and free our ſelves from their slavery, and to recover our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Religion. When this is done you ſhall have your Fathers and Uncles Eſtates in lieu of your Services, for I intend you ſhall be my own Lieutenant, for I am to have a Regiment, by which means I ſhall have an opportunity to advance you; for the King of <hi>France</hi> hath promiſed us aid of Ten thouſand men and twenty thouſand Arms to carry on the deſign. At this time the ſaid <hi>Mac Everie</hi> gave this Deponent a Caſe of Piſtols and about Thirty Shillings in money, to carry Letters to Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Oſſulivan</hi> at <hi>Beer-Haven,</hi> and directed him. That if this Deponent
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100560:8"/>
ſhould be queſtioned on the way, to declare he belonged to the Army; accordingly this Deponent delivered his Letters, and returned with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, Purſuant whereunto, Captain <hi>Everie</hi> went to Captain <hi>Purdens</hi> Houſe, where was a great Meeting of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Gentry of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who rejoyced much at the anſwer of the ſaid Letters, but what they were this Deponent knoweth not, but that at that time they were ſworn to Secreſie upon a great Book, which this Deponent thinks was the Life of the Saints, <hi>viz. John Purden, Thomas Mac Everie, Euſtauce White, John Hurley, John Bourke,</hi> with many others, which this Deponent hath forgot at preſent. That there were ſeveral other Meetings, ſometimes at <hi>Mac Everie</hi>'s, ſometimes <hi>Purdens</hi> where they uſually drank a Health to the proſperity and good ſucceſs of the deſign; after which they all kneeled down and ſaid an <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> with other Prayers.</p>
            <p>That this Deponent going another time to <hi>Beer-Haven</hi> with Letters ſaw in the Harbour a French Man of War, who as this Deponent was informed, came on purpoſe to ſound the Harbour and to try the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds and the poſture of their Aſſiſtance, if there were an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Upon this Deponents returning to Mr, <hi>Everies</hi> with an anſwer, there was another great meeting of the Gentry, and great Rejoycing at the ſaid <hi>Sullivanes</hi> anſwer. Not long after this, the Deponent went again to <hi>Sullivane,</hi> but at his return with Letters their countenances were much changed to what they were formerly, for this Deponent was given to underſtand, that the <hi>French</hi> King being involved in a War with the Emperour &amp; <hi>Spaniard,</hi> could not poſſibly ſpare thoſe Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances he had formerly promiſed, for that he rather wanted Men to ſupply his own Army, ſo that for a long time this Affair ſtept, having no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from abroad but of late, by the Induſtry of the Prieſts and ſome other great Agents, their deſigns begin to take life again, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aſſurance that the French King being at Peace with his Neighbours will in a ſhort time make good his promiſe as to his former intended aid.</p>
            <p>That this Deponent reflecting with much Reluctancy on the ſad Subject he was engaged in to the ruine of the Nation, applyed himſelf to Father <hi>Brodeene</hi> the Pariſh Prieſt, and in confeſſion deſired to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved of his ſo heinous offence in being aſſiſtant to the Diſturbance of the Kingdom; Upon which the ſaid Prieſt bitterly Curſt him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to ſecreſie, and that if he did deſiſt from carrying on the Deſign, he ſhould be eternally Damned. Some little time after, this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100560:8"/>
Deponent being from home, had his Houſe broken open, Rob'd of his Money, the aforeſaid Piſtols, and all his Papers wherein he had kept a Catalogue of all the Names, and the preciſe times of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Meetings, Swearings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which this Deponent gueſſes that the Prieſt had aquainted them with his Confeſſion.</p>
